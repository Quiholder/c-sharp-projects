There are some small projects I made using C# and .Net Framework

Project:
Car Insurance

This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes the user's input
on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view
all of the quotes that have been issued.
